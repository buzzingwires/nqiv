`nqiv` is not curently considered a project where security is a critical consideration. Mundane crash conditions and bugs can be reported normally through the issue tracker or a pull request. Things that expose user data, enable malicious code execution (especially through the `nqiv` command format in `cmd.h`), or other concerns may be reported through GitHub's vulnerability reporting system.
