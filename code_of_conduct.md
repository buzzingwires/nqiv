# nqiv Code of Conduct

Generally speaking, the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html) is a good set of guidelines. nqiv's code of conduct espouses similar values, while elaborating on how to reason about the social aspect of development to hopefully avoid common issues.

* **Discrimination of all kinds is unacceptable.** Those who practice or facilitate it will not be welcome in this project. This includes, but is not limited to discrimination targeting age, appearance, bodytype, disability, education, ethnicity, experience level, gender identity and expression, nationality, race, religion, sexual orientation, or socio-economic background.

* **Prioritize the wellness of the project.** Conflict should be in service to this, rather than personal vendettas.

* **Try to generally be nice.** Avoid things that are likely to make others feel disrespected, belittled, or uncomfortable. Even if you don't see any issue with it, consider how important it is that you say a certain thing a certain way. The goal is not to police tone for its own sake, but to encourage empathy.

* **Remember that everyone makes mistakes.** We all started off knowing nothing, and we all have bad ideas. Feeling safe to make mistakes fosters creativity, and encourages personal growth.

* **Criticize code, not people.** Focus on how the code may be improved ("This function may be more readable if written like this.", or "Wouldn't doing it this way cause this issue?", rather than "This is bad", or worse "You are stupid for having written something so bad.").

* **Non-developers have valuable feedback.** The project being free and open source does not exempt it from being constructively criticized by non-developers. Users (and anyone else) should be directed to documentation as necessary, and repeated confusion may indicate an issue with the project.

* **Respect the boundaries set by others.** We all live in different situations, have different needs of privacy and dynamics we're comfortable with. Generally speaking, if somebody asks you to stop, then stop.

* **This is a living document.** It might be changed as the needs of the project changes, or as issues arise.
